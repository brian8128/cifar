Playing with Googles image classification CNN

Goals:
Save the model and work on it later
Run the model on EC2
Automatically request ec2 instances and work on the model when they're cheap
* Can we create an AMI that has everything we need that automatically starts working on training the (current) model
  on startup and saves periodically
Modify the model parameters
Incorporate some deep dream like ideas: What happens when we train an image of a truck to be more cat like?
